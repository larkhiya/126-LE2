    description: "Holden Caulfield, a sixteen-year-old recently expelled from Pencey Prep, embarks on a journey through New York City in search of meaning and connection. Navigating the city's seedy hotels, bustling streets, and familiar haunts, he encounters a series of fleeting interactions that highlight his deep sense of alienation. Haunted by the death of his younger brother Allie and disillusioned by the 'phoniness' of the adult world, Holden seeks solace in memories of his sister Phoebe and dreams of preserving innocence. J.D. Salinger's seminal novel captures the complexities of adolescence, the pain of growing up, and the enduring quest for authenticity in a superficial world."
